#In this project, I used SQL Server to analyze Youtube data from around the world with a dataset downloaded from Kaggle. 
 
#1. How many subscribers does Mr. Beast have?
SELECT Youtuber, subscribers  
FROM dbo.Global_Youtube_Demographics
WHERE Youtuber='MrBeast'

#2. Find all the Youtubers who are from the United States and over 10,000,000 subscribers.
SELECT DISTINCT Youtuber, Country, subscribers
FROM dbo.Global_Youtube_Demographics
WHERE subscribers > 10000000 AND Country='United States'

#3. Find all the Youtubers who have the most subscribers under the category 'Sports' in descending order.
SELECT Youtuber, MAX(subscribers) AS Number_Of_Subscribers 
FROM dbo.Global_Youtube_Demographics
WHERE Category='Sports'
GROUP BY Youtuber, subscribers 
ORDER BY Number_Of_Subscribers DESC

#4. Which entertainment channel has the most subscribers in descending order?
SELECT DISTINCT Youtuber, subscribers, channel_type 
FROM dbo.Global_Youtube_Demographics
WHERE channel_type= 'Entertainment' 
ORDER BY Youtuber DESC


#5. Find all the Youtubers that have the highest yearly earnings that are from the music category.
SELECT Youtuber, Category, highest_yearly_earnings
FROM dbo.Global_Youtube_Demographics 
LEFT JOIN dbo.Global_Youtube_Statistics
ON dbo.Global_Youtube_Demographics.rank=dbo.Global_Youtube_Statistics.rank 
WHERE Category='Music'

#6. How many Youtube Channels were created in 2005?
SELECT DISTINCT Youtuber, created_year
FROM dbo.Global_Youtube_Demographics
LEFT JOIN dbo.Global_Youtube_Statistics
ON dbo.Global_Youtube_Demographics.rank=dbo.Global_Youtube_Statistics.rank
WHERE created_year='2005'
ORDER BY Youtuber ASC

#7. Find all the Youtubers whoâ€™s content is educational with the highest monthly and yearly earnings that earned over 10,000,000 subscribers. 
SELECT Youtuber, channel_type, highest_monthly_earnings, highest_yearly_earnings, MAX (subscribers) AS NumofSubscribers
FROM dbo.Global_Youtube_Demographics
JOIN dbo.Global_Youtube_Statistics
ON dbo.Global_Youtube_Demographics.rank=dbo.Global_Youtube_Statistics.rank 
WHERE channel_type= 'Education' 
GROUP BY Youtuber, channel_type, highest_monthly_earnings, highest_yearly_earnings
HAVING MAX (subscribers) > 10000000
ORDER BY NumofSubscribers ASC

#8. Write a query showing the relationship between the Youtubers and how many uploads they have by removing any duplicate values. 
WITH CTE_Global AS 
(SELECT DISTINCT Youtuber, subscribers, category, uploads
, COUNT (category) OVER (PARTITION BY category) asCategoryCount
, AVG (uploads) OVER (PARTITION BY category) as AvgUploads
FROM dbo.Global_Youtube_Demographics AS dem
JOIN dbo.Global_Youtube_Statistics AS stat
ON dem.rank=stat.rank
WHERE uploads > 1000
)
SELECT Youtuber, uploads 
FROM CTE_Global

#9. Which Youtuber has the most subscribers that has greater than 10,000 uploads? 
SELECT DISTINCT  Youtuber, subscribers, uploads 
FROM dbo.Global_Youtube_Demographics
WHERE Youtuber in (SELECT Youtuber
FROM dbo.Global_Youtube_Demographics
WHERE uploads >10000) 
ORDER BY uploads DESC

#10. Write a query to describe the Youtubers who have over 10 million subscribers as successful and less than one million subscribers as not successful. 
SELECT Youtuber, subscribers,    
CASE  
WHEN subscribers >10000000 THEN 'successful' 
WHEN subscribers BETWEEN 1000000 AND 999999999 THEN 'moderately successful' 
ELSE 'not successful' 
END AS YoutubeSuccess
FROM dbo.Global_Youtube_Demographics
